# Phone_Directory


Created phone directory where we can add, delete and modify any contact. 

This program take input from test_input.txt and sort the item according to their first name. If first name is same it sorts according to last name. 


For sorting contact list according to their name I have used randomized quicksort algorithm and for searching any name from directory I have used binary search algorithm
